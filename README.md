# Database-managing-panel
A GUI panel made to easily work with your mySQL Database and get rid of that black and complicated mySQL command.
This a GUI panel for managing data on your mySQL databases. You just need to enter your database's URL, username, password and your driver address in first lines of the class. 
By default there is a table named "list" which is created in a database that has five colomns. ID(that is auto increment),
Firstname, Lastname, NationalID and BirthYear. You can change the name of table and colomns according to your need and usage. As easy as changing the name of some variables!
